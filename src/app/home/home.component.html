          The Northwestern University Student Chapter of the Institute of
          Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE NU) is an organization
          dedicated to providing the resources and outlets through which the
          University's aspiring engineers, tinkerers, and hackers can learn and
          create with their craft. Our chapter is directly supported and funded
          by Northwestern University's
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/">

        <h3>Educate</h3>
        <p>
          IEEE co-hosts educational CS events with other groups on campus and
          provides hands-on training that is supplemental to Northwestern's
          education in areas like web development and career prep. HackNights
          include presentations with hands-on coding activities, as well as
          catered food for attendees.

        <h3>Explore</h3>
        <p>
          Every year, IEEE helps motivated students develop a side project under
          the leadership of a student mentor. This program provides students
          with the opportunity to gain experience in computer science and become
          a member of IEEE. These projects are then entered in a showcase open
          to all Northwestern students.

        <h3>Engage</h3>
        <p>
          It is important that IEEE connects with the greater Northwestern
          community, both to foster relationships between the organization and
          other students, as well as ensure that students know what
          opportunities are available to them in computer science. Many of
          IEEE's events are open to all Northwestern students.
