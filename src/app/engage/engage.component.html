    <h2>EECS BBQ</h2>
    <p>
      While Northwestern students are known for their drive and commendable work
      ethic, we also like to have fun! Once a year, during our spring quarter,
      the members of IEEE NU fire up a few grills and host a barbecue for all
      Northwestern students, faculty, and staff. This event, known as the EECS
      BBQ, is funded by Northwestern's EECS department and gives everyone a
      chance to relax and connect with others in the Northwestern community and
      learn about IEEE.
    </p>
    <h2>BadHacks</h2>
    <p>
      BadHacks is IEEE NUâ€™s annual 8 hour mini-hackathon. Here, Northwestern
      students are encouraged to bring their worst tech ideas to life. Prizes
      are awarded to participants who develop the best projects in certain
      categories and all are able to enjoy free food while hacking. Group
      activities and video games are also provided to give hackers a break from
      developing their projects. This event provides students with an
      opportunity to meet other students interested in computer science and
      practice their coding skills in a fun, focused environment.
